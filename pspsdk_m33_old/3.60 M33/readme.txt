This is the SDK for 3.XX M33.
If you are not a developer, exit this directory as this won't interest you.

It includes the M33 modules library and includes, and an extension of the pspsdk libraries 
with some 3.XX functions.

All M33 functions are available in 3.52 M33-3 and later (the ones inherited from OE are available in
all versions).

Only function that is not available in 3.52 M33-3 and 4, is kuKernelGetModel (detects psp slim from user mode), 
which has been added in 3.60 M33
