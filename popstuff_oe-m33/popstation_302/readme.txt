popstation is a program that will convert your psx games into an eboot.pbp playable in 3.02 OE-B
firmware.

Before starting to read, a note:

European games (pal) give various graphics problems: graphics glitches, and displacement of screen.

It's better to use only ntsc games (american and japanese), whenever possible.

Instructions:

- Get the Hot shots 2 game of the playstation store, and its keys.bin, and put it in the same
  directory than popstation, renaming it from EBOOT.PBP to BASE.PBP.

  Even if using other ps3store game could work, it is not recommended because the program was
  done specifically using this one. USE HOT SHOTS 2 USA.

  (Note: this is needed in order to get the data.psp and a few data).

- Backup your psx CD to a cd image, using some tool for that.

- Put the iso in the same directory than popstation.

- Execute popstation.exe from the command line. You have to pass one parameter, which is the filename
of the iso. e.g:

> popstation castlevania.iso

The program will generate the EBOOT.PBP, it may take some time, depending of the size of the iso.

By default, the program will use the ICON0.PNG, PIC0.PNG and PIC1.PNG from the BASE.PBP. (hot shots)
If you want to use your own pics, place them in the same directory than popstation, and he will
take those.

Note: DO NOT use programs such as pbpunpacker to modify pbp's generated by popstation. They won't 
work after that.

Note2: The program is compiled using cygwin. Therefore, cygwin dll's are required if you don't have them
Google cygwin1.dll to find it.

- Transfer the EBOOT.PBP WITH the KEYS.BIN to the folder you like inside /PSP/GAME and launching it
from 3.02 OE-B XMB.

FAQ:

Q: My game generated is a lot higher in size than the same one from ps3store...
A: They use compression. Because the algorithm of compression is not still reversed, compressed
   isos are not supported yet.

Q: I have my game in bin/cue...
A: use the bin as the iso.

Q: I have my game in img/ccd...
A: Use the img as the iso.

Q: The savegames have the icon of Hot Shots 2!!!
