docmaker is a tool to generate a DOCUMENT.DAT (manual) file for a psx game

A DOCUMENT.DAT is no more than a collection of png's images packed in a file.
You can put inside a manual, a game faq, the secret photo of your girlfriend naked, etc, 
whatever you want.

docmaker is a command line tool. you have to pass 2 parameters:

1: the game code, which  must start by SCUS, SLUS, SLES, SCES, SCED, SLPS, SLPM, SCPS, SLED,
   SLPS, SIPS or ESPM, and be followed by a number of 5 digits.
2: a directory path.

The directory has to have png files inside with the names 0000.PNG, 0001.PNG, etc with a minimum
of 1 file, and maximum of 9999 (however, i don't know which is the limit that the sony emulator supports).

e.g.

> docmaker SLPM11111 mydirectorywithphotos


Decrypted DOCUMENT.DAT can be used in 3.03 OE-A. 3.02 OE-B doesn't support decrypted DOCUMENT.DAT.

Note that games bought at ps3store don't support the decrypted document.dat generated by this tool
However the psx games generated by you using popstation or similar tool can support both, encrypted
ones from the ps3store and decrypted ones generated by this tool.

(the technical reason is just that when a psx game bought in the ps3store is detected, OE doesn't do
any patches to the system).
