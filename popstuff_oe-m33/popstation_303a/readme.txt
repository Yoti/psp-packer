popstation is a program that will convert your psx games into an eboot.pbp playable in 3.03 OE-A
firmware.

NOTE: eboot.pbp generated by this tool may not work in 3.02 OE-B due to some changes (however all 
eboot.pbp generated by the previous version work ok in 3.03 OE-A)

Before starting to read, a note:

European games (pal) give various graphics problems: graphics glitches, and displacement of screen.

It's better to use only ntsc games (american and japanese), whenever possible.

Instructions:

- Get the Hot shots 2 game of the playstation store, and its keys.bin, and put it in the same
  directory than popstation, renaming it from EBOOT.PBP to BASE.PBP.

  Even if using other ps3store game could work, it is not recommended because the program was
  done specifically using this one. USE HOT SHOTS 2 USA.

  (Note: this is needed in order to get the data.psp and a few data).

- Backup your psx CD to a cd image, using some tool for that.

- Put the iso in the same directory than popstation.

- Execute popstation.exe from the command line. You have to pass 4 parameters:

1: The title of the game

2: the game code, which  must start by SCUS, SLUS, SLES, SCES, SCED, SLPS, SLPM, SCPS, SLED,
   SLPS, SIPS or ESPM, and be followed by a number of 5 digits.

3: Compression level, a number between 0-9. 
   0 indicates no compression. 9 indicates maximum compression, but the program will take more time to compress the iso.
   1 indicates minimum compression, but the program will take less time to compress the file.
   The rest of values are intermediate between those, with 6 being the default compromise between
   the speed and the compression.

4: the path of the iso.

Example:

> popstation "DraculaX - Nocturne in the moonlight" SLPM86023 9 draculax.iso

The program will generate the EBOOT.PBP, it may take some time, depending of the size of the iso and the compression level.

The way in which the icons and other files are put inside the pbp has changed from the previous version.

Now there is no limit in size, and you can also add snd0.at3 and icon1.pmf, appart from icon0.png, pic0.png, pic1.png.
The behaviour is the following:

if you have one of the files in the same directory as the application, the program will take that
for the pbp. Otherwise, the PBP will miss that certain file. This is true, except in the case of icon0.png,
where if no one is found in the same directry as the app, the application will use the one from base.pbp.


Note: The program is compiled using cygwin. Therefore, cygwin dll's are required if you don't have them
Google cygwin1.dll to find it. (note: also cygz.dll is required in this version, due to use of zlib)

- Transfer the EBOOT.PBP WITH the KEYS.BIN to the folder you like inside /PSP/GAME and launching it
from 3.03 OA-A XMB.
